<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest?

My interest in IT is the fact that I just love technology, whether is be setting up a computer to setting up an electronics device and everything in between. This fascination in IT started when I very young, like 8 or 9 years old, I always saw it as a hobby and something fun to do but challenging at the same time. I guess, the event that sparked by interest in IT when when I was around 10 or 11 when as in school. Myself and a couple of other kids that excelled in computer studies we assisted in creating the schools first website.

Why did you choose to come to RMIT?

I chose to study though RMIT as I felt it was going to be the best fit for me personally. From the subjects that are offered in the course and how they will help assist me later on in my professional career to the fact how engaging it is, especially when you are studying online, you don't feel like that your by yourself and have to go at it alone since you aren't able to have the "classroom experience' offered at your typical university. One of the bonuses of studying at RMIT, is that how well known it is and the chance of achieving a great position.

What do you expect to learn during your studies?

What I expect to learn throughout my degree is to be able to write in different form of code that is issued in the professional industry, assist in preparing me for what employers expectation on the required skills need to succeed within the industry, understand the different pathways there are with in the IT industry. As I want to become a programmer/developer, it is import to be able to hone your skills and perfect your craft, this degree will allow be to achieve just that but most importantly is to be excited about what you do for work and be excited/happy about going to work in the morning.
