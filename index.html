<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest?

My interest in IT is the fact that I just love technology, whether is be setting up a computer to setting up an electronics device and everything in between. This fascination in IT started when I very young, like 8 or 9 years old, I always saw it as a hobby and something fun to do but challenging at the same time. I guess, the event that sparked by interest in IT when when I was around 10 or 11 when as in school. Myself and a couple of other kids that excelled in computer studies we assisted in creating the schools first website.

Why did you choose to come to RMIT?

I chose to study though RMIT as I felt it was going to be the best fit for me personally. From the subjects that are offered in the course and how they will help assist me later on in my professional career to the fact how engaging it is, especially when you are studying online, you don't feel like that your by yourself and have to go at it alone since you aren't able to have the "classroom experience' offered at your typical university. One of the bonuses of studying at RMIT, is that how well known it is and the chance of achieving a great position.

What do you expect to learn during your studies?

What I expect to learn throughout my degree is to be able to write in different form of code that is issued in the professional industry, assist in preparing me for what employers expectation on the required skills need to succeed within the industry, understand the different pathways there are with in the IT industry. As I want to become a programmer/developer, it is import to be able to hone your skills and perfect your craft, this degree will allow be to achieve just that but most importantly is to be excited about what you do for work and be excited/happy about going to work in the morning.

<h2>The results of an online Myers-Briggs test</h2>

 Results : ISFPs have a great deal of warmth but may not show it until they know a person well. They enjoy the present moment and are often relaxed and easygoing. They are loyal and committed to their values and to those important to them. They are modest about their abilities, dislike disagreements and conflict, and do not force their values or opinions on others. They value home, family, health, and financial security.
Characteristics of ISFPs • ISFPs try to take time to enjoy the people and the world around them.
• They are attuned to the sensory details in their environment.
• ISFPs find quiet satisfaction in simple pleasures.
• They learn more by doing than by reading.
• Their easygoing nature often hides their deep values and commitments. ISFPs with Others
• ISFPs care deeply about people but may show it more through acts of kindness than through words.
• They are loyal and committed to people important to them.
• They are faithful in fulfilling obligations to others.
• ISFPs are attuned to the feelings and needs of others and flexible in responding to them.
• They tend to be quiet and unassuming, and so may underrate themselves and be underestimated by others.
• Their warmth, enthusiasm, and playful humor may not be apparent to people who don’t know them well.
• They have little wish to dominate or control in interpersonal situations.
ISFPs at Work • ISFPs want to have a purpose beyond their paycheck. They want to contribute to people’s well-being or happiness and will work with energy and dedication when doing something they believe in.
• They are perfectionists when they care deeply about something, and are particularly suited for work that requires both devotion and adaptability.
• They like to have their own space and to work within their own time frame.
• They often excel in craftsmanship, and their handiwork is usually more eloquent than their words.
• Many ISFPs have a special love of nature and a sympathy with animals.
• They are apt to enjoy fields in which taste, discrimination, and a sense of beauty and proportion are important.
• They tend to gravitate toward work that allows them to contribute to human understanding, happiness, or health, such as positions in teaching and healthcare.
• They don’t like jobs that require an analytical, impersonal approach to people.
Potential Blind Spots for ISFPs
• If ISFPs have not developed their Feeling preference, they may not take the time to go inside and consider their values and therefore may make decisions they later regret.
• Or, they may avoid making decisions altogether, allowing others or circumstances to decide for them.
• If they have not developed their Sensing preference, ISFPs may have no reliable way of getting accurate data about the external world, and their decisions will then be overly personal.
• ISFPs may feel such a contrast between their ideals and their accomplishments that they burden themselves with a sense of inadequacy. This can be true even when they are being just as effective as others.
• The most modest of all the types, ISFPs tend to underrate and understate themselves and may take for granted anything they do well. They may then become overly sensitive and vulnerable, with dwindling confidence in themselves.
